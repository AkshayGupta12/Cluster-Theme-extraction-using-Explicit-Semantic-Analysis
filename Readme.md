# Cluster Theme extraction using Explicit Semantic Analysis
This project is a research assignment part of the **Natural Language Processing (CS6370) course at I.I.T. Madras**. We propose an unsupervised text clustering method in a semantically rich concept space along with heuristics to arrive at the theme of the document clusters.
There are two main code files: NLP_project_NIPS and NLP_project_Newsgroup. 

For NIPS dataset:
1. Download document inputs from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1kwPwquljFAOHP439poGdOFGVnou5954Z
	* Extract 'ML_input.csv' from the downloaded folder and copy it to Code\Doc_inputs\NIPS folder
2. Download ESA inputs from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1HUd-BzXJFH8EWwSxQ4rBiLN39YUnKGhK
	* Extract the downloaded zip and copy all the raw files to the folder Code\ESA_input\NIPS
3. Run the NLP_project_NIPS.py file.
	
For Newsgroup dataset:
1. Download document inputs from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1uN_7XMESxecKhzuJnr3PC_mNndvyJE48
	* Extract three .csv files from the downloaded folder and copy it to Code\Doc_inputs\Newsgroup folder
2. Download ESA inputs from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1sAPnGqt9_Pz2gvzaQmWKS-jQtQJAc-UR
	* Extract the downloaded zip and copy all the raw files to the folder Code\ESA_input\Newsgroup folder
3. Run the NLP_project_Newsgroup.py file.	

Entire dataset for single download can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1re-uo67YTH445fsOLsDvhFF1bOffWxtV	
		
Results of both of these is discussed in the results section of the report.
